Notably, these solutions were sometimes designed to incorporate HTTP authentication mechanisms, ensuring proper security. <br> I developed and integrated these automated processes into separate Jenkins jobs, all housed within preset Docker containers. This efficient setup allows our team to execute tasks effortlessly with just a few predefined triggers.

This portfolio was built using ReactJS,  with a focus on making it as streamlined and modern as possible. I have a passion for creating websites that not only look good, but feel good to navigate.

Notably, these solutions were sometimes designed to incorporate HTTP authentication mechanisms, ensuring proper security. <br> I developed and integrated these automated processes into separate Jenkins jobs, all housed within preset Docker containers. This efficient setup allows our team to execute tasks effortlessly with just a few predefined triggers.

It is an old-school text adventure set in a magical tower, and was an opportunity to not only build a fully functional application  (with a focus on UX and clean code), but also an opportunity to mix development with my passion as a gamer.

This portfolio was built using ReactJS,  with a focus on making it as streamlined and modern as possible. I have a passion for creating websites that not only look good, but feel good to navigate.

I love finding ways to enhance the story with melodic themes and leitmotifs.
